						<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>							
						<p>
							<span class="bold">Are you still an active clan?</span><br>
							No, not really. Even though <span class="line-through">we are still runing some Half-Life Deathmatch gameserver</span> we don't have enough time to play regularly anymore.
							<br><br>	
							<span class="bold">How can I contact you?</span><br>
							Write an email to chris [at] qrt.de.
							<br><br>
							<span class="line-through"><span class="bold">I got kicked/banned! Why?</span><br>
							We are running Valves Anti Cheat and <a href="http://www.steambans.com/">SteamBans</a> on our gameserver to make sure everyone plays fair. Our stated aim is to keep a old classic deathmatch environment. This means the use of scripts are not permitted and will effect as a kick or temporary ban on our sever.</span> 
							<br><br>		
							<span class="bold">What\'s wrong with using scripts?</span><br>
							Using scripts is definitively not oldschool and has nothing to do with skills.
							<br><br>
							<span class="bold">Can you sponsor us a gameserver?</span><br>
							No, who gave you that idea?
							<br><br>
							<span class="bold">Can I join spezi|Clan?</span><br>
							No, see first answer.
							<br><br>
							<span class="bold">So what\'s this all about?</span><br>
							We are just an old clan trying to keep Half-Life alive.
							<br><br>
							<span class="bold">Where can I download the map, which covers the background of the spezi|Homepage?</span><br>
							Believe it or not but this "map" was only designed for this website by spezi|Cola. In fact it\'s only a small room and is therefore not playable. If you are looking for HLDM maps check out <a href="http://www.snarkpit.net">snarkpit.net</a>.
							<br><br>
							<span class="bold">Who designed this webpage?</span><br>
							spezi|Cola did all the designing and coding.
							<br><br>
							<span class="bold">Could you design us a clanpage?</span><br>
							No, unless you pay us ;)
