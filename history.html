					<h1>History</h1>
					<div class="content">
						<p>
							The spezi|Clan was officially founded as a German <a href="http://www.counter-strike.net">Counter-Strike</a> clan in June 2001 by Cola, Fanta, Apfelsaft and Doppelkorn to play as a team on the Internet.
							<br><br>
  							However the story starts way back in fall 1998 when Cola and  Fanta visited their friend who introduced them to Half-Life Deathmatch for the first time.<br><br>
  							During that time the brothers played all kind of modifications of Half-Life but most of all the original Half-Life Deathmatch. Later in August 1999 Christian R. told them about <a href="http://www.counter-strike.net">Counter-Strike</a> as a modification and since then the Spezis have not stopped playing  until CS version 1.4 was released in April 2002.
							<br><br>
  							The creation of the name <em>spezi</em> was random and never planed to be used as a clanname.
